This section deals with setting up the initial workspace and codebase for the "Contacts" application. 
The goal of this step lies in the project setup that closely matches the "Contacts" application. 
This includes the organization and naming of Maven modules and the individual Java packages.

The creation up of the initial project setup described in this section consists of the tasks listed below.

* <<sec-contacts_initial_codebase>>
* <<sec-contacts_remove_stuff>>
* <<sec-contacts_change_workoutline>>
* <<sec-contacts_change_desktop>>
* <<sec-contacts_default_theme>>

This first step of the "Contacts" tutorial ends with a review of the results of this first tutorial step in section <<sec-contacts_summary>>.

[[sec-contacts_initial_codebase]]
==== Creating the initial Codebase

The initial code for the "`Contacts`" application is generated using the [wizard]_New Scout Project_ wizard. 
For the wizard fields you may use the values below and as shown in <<img-sdk_new_project_tutorial>>

* [field]_Group Id_: `org.eclipse.scout.contacts`
* [field]_Artefact Id_: `org.eclipse.scout.contacts`
* [field]_Display Name_: "Contacts Application"

To create this initial application click on btn:[Finish].
The project wizard then creates a number of Maven modules as shown in <<img-contacts_package_explorer>>.

[[sec-contacts_remove_stuff]]
==== Removing unnecessery Components

We start with removing the `\*.helloworld` and `\*.settings` packages in all Maven modules of the "Contacts" application. 
To delete a packages first select an individual package or packages in the Eclipse package explorer as shown in <<img-contacts_package_explorer>> and then hit the kbd:[Delete] key.

The packages to delete is provided per Maven module in the list below. 

Client Module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client`::
* In folder `src/main/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.helloworld` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.settings` 
* In folder `src/test/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.helloworld` 

Server Module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server`::
* In folder `src/main/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.helloworld` 
* In folder `src/test/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.helloworld` 

Shared Module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared`::
* In folder `src/main/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared.helloworld` 
* In folder `src/generated/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared.helloworld` 

The deletion of these outlines results in a number of compile errors in classes `WorkOutline` and `Desktop`. 
All these errors will be resolved in the following two sections where we modify the two classes to our needs. 

[[sec-contacts_change_workoutline]]
==== Changes to Class WorkOutline

Instead of adding a new "Contacts" outline to the application we reuse the generated code and rename the "Work" outline into "Contacts" outline. 
For this, we perform the following modifications to class `WorkOutline`.

* Rename the class package to `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.contact`
* Rename the class to `ContactOutline`
* Change the outline title to "Contact"
* Change the outline icon to `Icons.Category`

To quickly find class `WorkOutline` we first open the [wizard]_Open Type_ dialog from the Eclipse IDE by hitting kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T] and enter "workoutline" into the search field as shown in <<img-eclipse_open_type>>.
In the result list, we select the desired class and click the btn:[OK] button to open the file `WorkOutline.java` in the Java editor of the Eclipse IDE.

[[img-eclipse_open_type, Figure 000]]
image::{imgsdir}/eclipse_open_type.png[]
.Use the Open Type dialog to quickly find java types in the Eclipse IDE.

We start with the package rename.
To rename the package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.work` to `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.contact` click into the word "work" of the package name and hit kbd:[Alt+Shift+R].
This opens the package rename dialog as shown in <<img-sdk_rename_package>> where re replace "work" by "contacts" in the [element]_New name_ field. 

[[img-sdk_rename_package, Figure 000]]
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_rename_package.png[]
.Use the Eclipse Rename Package dialog to rename a Java package.

In next step we rename class `WorkOutline` to `ContactOutline`. 
In the Java editor we can then rename the class by clicking into the class identifier `WorkOutline` and hitting kbd:[Alt+Shift+R].

Inside the edit box we can then change the class name to `ContactOutline` and hit the btn:[Enter] key to execute the change. 
If Eclipse shows a Rename Type dialog just hit button btn:[Continue] to let Eclipse complete the rename operation.
To get rid of the compile error in method `execCreateChildPages` we simply delete the content in the method body.

Next, we change the outline title in method `getConfiguredTitle` by replacing the string "Work" with "Contacts", setting the cursor at the end of the word "Contacts" and hitting kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to open the Scout content assist as shown in <<img-sdk_new_text_entry_contact>>.

[[img-sdk_new_text_entry_contact, Figure 000]]
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_new_text_entry_contact.png[]
.Use the Scout content assist to add new translations.

To enter a new translated text we double click on the proposal [element]_New text..._ to open the Scout new entry wizard as shown in <<img-sdk_new_text_entry_contact_wizard>>.

[[img-sdk_new_text_entry_contact_wizard, Figure 000]]
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_new_text_entry_contact_wizard.png[]

As the last modification we change the return value of method `getConfiguredIconId` to value `Icons.Category` and end with the code shown in <<lst-contacts_outline>>.

[[lst-contacts_outline, Listing contacts outline]]
[source,java]
.Initial implementation of class ContactOutline.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/contact/ContactOutline.java[tags=OutlineInit]
----

To conclude the modifications we update the imports by hitting kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+O] and save the modified class using kbd:[Ctrl+S].

[[sec-contacts_change_desktop]]
==== Changes to Class Desktop

The second class to adapt for the "Contacts" application is the `Desktop` class. 
This class is implemented exactly once in each Scout application and holds the available outlines and top level menus of the application in the form of inner classes.

For the "Contacts" application we adapt the initial implementation to have outline view buttons for the "Contacts" and "Search" outlines. 
The top level menus are then adapted to hold the menus "Quick Access", "Options" and a menu for the logged in user. 

Start with opening the class in the Java editor using kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T] to quickly access the class. 
In the source code of method `getConfiguredOutlines` remove `SettingsOutline.class` from the list of return values in as shown in <<lst-contacts_getConfiguredOutlines>>.

[[lst-contacts_getConfiguredOutlines, Listing getConfiguredOutlines]]
[source,java]
.Method getConfiguredOutlines defines the outlines associated with the desktop of the application.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/Desktop.java[tags=getConfiguredOutlines]
----

Then, perform the following changes in class `Desktop`

* Delete inner class `SettingOutlineViewButton`
* Rename inner class WorkOutlineViewButton to `ContactOutlineViewButton`
* Rename FileMenu to `QuickAccessMenu`, let `getConfiguredText` return "Quick Access" and delete the remaining content.
* Rename BookmarkMenu to `OptionsMenu`. Add methods `getConfiguredText` and  `getConfiguredIconId` according to <<lst-contacts_desktop>>.
* Change HelpMenu to `UserMenu`. Remove method `getConfiguredText` and add method `getConfiguredIconId` that returns `AbstractIcons.Person`.

At the end of these changes the inner class structure of class Desktop will look like shown in <<lst-contacts_desktop>>.  

[[lst-contacts_desktop, Listing Desktop]]
[source,java]

----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/Desktop.java[tags=DesktopInit]
----

<1> In your implementation `QuickAccesMenu` should extend `AbstractMenu`
<2> In your implementation `UserMenu` should extend `AbstractMenu`

[[sec-contacts_default_theme]]
==== Switching to the Default Theme

We will use the Scout default theme for the "Contacts" application. 
The initial code base created above comes with a very simple project specific "application" theming. 

To disable the theming property follow the steps described below.

. Expand the module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.ui.html.app.dev` in the Eclipse package explorer
. Expand folder `src/main/resources`
. Open file `config.property` in a text editor
. Comment out property `scout.ui.theme` as shown in <<lst-contacts_theming_property>>
. Save the modified property file

[[lst-contacts_theming_property, Listing theming property]]
[source]
.Commenting out the application specific theming re-activates the Scout default theme.
----
### Application theming
# scout.ui.theme=application // <1>

### Application Config
scout.application.version=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
scout.application.name=Contacts
----
    
<1> Comment out this line. Alternatively you may replace "application" with "default"


[[sec-contacts_summary]]
==== What have we achieved?

In the first step of the "Contacts" tutorial we have created the initial project setup that will serve as the basis for all the following tutorial steps. 

As the "Contacts" application is in a clean state you can now test the application using the following steps.
The user interface of the application will now look as shown in <<img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_1>>.

* Start the backend application
* Start the frontend application
* Open address in your http://localhost:8082/[http://localhost:8082/] browser

[[img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_1, Figure 000]]
.The "Contacts" application at the end of tutorial step 1.
image::{imgsdir}/contacts_tutorial_result_step_1.png[]

From the coding perspective we now have all necessary maven Modules for "Contacts" application including Java package and class names to match with the complete Scout "Contacts" demo application. 
This point is important as it simplifies the comparison of intermediate stages of the tutorial application with the Scout demo application. 
The same is true for the user perspective: The layout of the current state of the tutorial matches with the complete "Contacts" sample application.
